I am a third-year PhD student at CERFACS, Toulouse working on Numerical Simulation of Plasma Assisted Combustion in the GECCO project and Resolution of Partial Differential Equations using Neural Networks.

Main author of the [PlasmaNet](https://gitlab.com/cerfacs/plasmanet) deep-learning library to study coupling of Neural Networks inside plasma simulations.

Main author of the [AVIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01291) Fortran code for multi-dimensional simulations of plasma assisted combustion.
